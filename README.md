## Description

The ToDo List App allows you to organize your tasks with detailed information such as title, description, and due date. You can mark tasks as complete or important, and manage them through various views such as today's tasks, important tasks, incomplete tasks, complete tasks, all tasks, and tasks by directory (folder). The application also supports dark mode and stores data in the local storage for persistence.

- **Task Filters**: View tasks by categories such as today, important, incomplete, complete, and all tasks.
- **Directories**: Organize tasks into folders. The "Main" directory cannot be edited or deleted.
- **Sorting**: Sort tasks by nearest, farthest, complete, or incomplete.
- **Search**: Search for tasks using the search field.
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle dark mode for a better viewing experience.
- **Local Storage**: Data is saved to local storage to maintain persistence across sessions.
